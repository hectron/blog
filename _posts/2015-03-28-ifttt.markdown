## TL; DR

You can set up a custom recipe in [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) to alert you
whenever a new listing is available on [Craigslist](http://craigslist.org/). 

Keep [this website loaded in the
background](https://ifttt.com/recipes/229-send-yourself-emails-for-new-craigslist-postings-from-any-search-you-re-interested-in).

On [Craigslist](http://craigslist.org/), perform a search, copy the URL from
the address bar after the search has been performed, paste it into the search
URL box in the IFTTT, enter in your e-mail, and make the recipe!

## A little background

One thing my readers should know is that I'm a stan of music -- all variety of
music. This is likely because I consider myself a hobbyist musician. As a
result, I suffer from what other musicians call **GAS** (not necessarily the
result of dietary choices). 

**GAS** is known in the musician's community as
**Gear Acquisition Syndrome**; **GAS** means that you love collection gear.

I currently use a [Vox AD30VT](http://www.voxshowroom.com/uk/amp/ad30.html), a
small amp that has a tube in the preamp. It was OK for small band practices,
but the clean volume was just not cutting it -- I need more wattage.

Before starting my quest to purchase an amp, I decided that whatever amp I got
needed to have the following:

- Affordability
- Reliability
- Volume
- Clean headroom

In short, I wanted a tube amp that was reliable and affordable. I set a budget
of $500 USD and performed research. 

After a few searches, I came to the
conclusion that a [Fender Blues
Deluxe](http://www.fender.com/guitar-amplifiers/vintage-pro-tube/blues-deluxe-reissue/product-223220.html)
or a [Peavey
Classic](http://peavey.com/products/index.cfm/item/801/118120/Classic%2030)
would have to be the amp that I choose.

Because these amps are just over my budget, enter Craigslist.

## Leveraging If This Then That (IFTTT)

As soon as I thought about monitoring a search query and ensuring I was
up-to-date with the search queries, I thought about automating this using
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). The idea is that I would perform a search query,
and anytime a new result was returned, I would get notified ASAP so that I
could act on it.

I'm using [this following recipe to monitor Craigslist
changes](https://ifttt.com/recipes/229-send-yourself-emails-for-new-craigslist-postings-from-any-search-you-re-interested-in).

The first thing I did was perform the search query that I needed. After that, I
copied the URL from the search result and pasted it into the Craiglist box
within the recipe page. 

I then entered an e-mail address and saved the recipe. After it was saved, I
went into My Recipes and ended up modifying it. I changed the subject of the 
e-mail to be `[CL Deal] Peavey Classic`.

However, if you're reading this blog, then you know I'm a bit more... unique
than the average internet user. Therefore, I ended up creating three different
alerts. Each one using the same term, but with a different maximum price.

This allowed me to change the subject of the e-mail that will be sent to myself
to something like `[CL BUY THIS NOW] Peavey Classic` or something of that
nature.

## Why not use Craigslist alerts?

I'm not going to lie -- I didn't know Craigslist alerts existed. Knowing that
now, I realize that one benefit that you have by using IFTTT is that you have a
centralized location for all your queries. Additionally, IFTTT will alert you
whenever something goes wrong with the service/integration.

## Final notes

Leveraging web automation tools like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) is a great way
to look for deals or to get alerts (weather, movies, etc). Hopefully by
leveraging these automation tools, I could stop hawking websites during work
hours and just wait for the deals to come to me rather than the other way
around.
