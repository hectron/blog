summary:    Nitrous offers a portable web development environment that works surprisingly well

## TL; DR

You can create a very functional development environment on Nitrous that is
accessible from anywhere that has an internet connection. Unfortunately, this is
a flaw. Without a fast connection, Nitrious might not be very accessible.

----------

Technologists are familiar with [Moore's
Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) which states that the number of
transistors doubles every two years. In turn, this affects our computeres and
phones by allowing us to have more processing power. 

But what happens when your processing power is so efficient that each hardware
upgrade is less enticing?

Personally, I consolidate my hardware to optimize it for Software engineering.

## Developing a plan

I found myself using the terminal and Google Chrome a lot. I use Virtual
machines for doing development on Linux environments.

My desktop is a custom built gaming computer that is seriously over-powered and
ridiculously underused; I don't really consume much media on my computer except
for light video watching on Netflix. 

Most of my media is stored in [the cloud](https://dropbox.com/),
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/) or in a [2 TB Western Digital Hard
Drive](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822236519).

Let's take inventory here:

- A terminal
- A browser

## When life gives you SaaS, you take it

There are [plenty of websites](http://lifehacker.com) out there that teach you
how to make use of many cloud services in creative ways. Seeing as how it's
increasingly difficult to not be connected in online services, I decided to
**endure** the cloud and try out [Nitrous.IO](https://nitrous.io/) to do my web
development from an online IDE. 

## The things it does good

Nitrous offers a [Google Chrome
App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nitrousio-web-app/kcbmakmdbnehgbakmgibcpjpafenmohd?hl=en)
that is amazing if you log into Chrome. This allows you to have Nitrous
installed on any Chrome you want.

The terminal it provides is a full-fledged Linux bash terminal, which means that
most of your favorite dotfiles can be implemented in the terminal. I was able to
set up a NodeJS server very quickly, and had a fully functional development
environment thanks to migrating my dotfiles to a Git repository.

Do not underestimate the ability to have a fully functional development
environment within minutes, that can be accessed from anywhere, on any kind of
machine. While this might be scary to some, it's not nearly as bad as you'd
think.

## The things it does bad

Nitrous can be slow at times, and it requires you to have a fast internet
connection. Without a fast internet connection, Nitrous can be slow and lag when
doing any text editing.

Having to set up an account on Nitrous might be another flaw for people.
