I'm Hector.

I've been working in the tech world since 2008, and consider myself a Polymath.
I live in Chicago proper and work for [Shoplocal](http://aboutshoplocal.com),
where I work as a contractor for our sister company, [BLiNQ Media](http://blinqmedia.com/).

At Shoplocal, I worked on mostly Javascript along with some C# and Python. Since
working with BLiNQ media, I've been working the full stack: Ruby, Node, Postgres,
MongoDB, Thrift and RabbitMQ.

This blog is not meant for me to boast; The primary purpose of this blog is to 
be educational. Every programmer must learn, even if the process is hard. If 
anything, this blog represents the seemingly easy issues that stump me.

With that in mind, please let me know if anything I blog about is incorrect or
could be done more efficiently.
