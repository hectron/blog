I'm Hector.

I've been working in the tech world since 2008. I am a Chicago native, and
currently work at [Amount](https://www.amount.com) as an engineering manager.

I started this blog back in 2015, with the intention of writing what I've
learned, written in such that individuals from different backgrounds can easily
digest the information.

Since then, I've focused a little less on programming itself and more general
how to deal with organizational conflict and management. I don't know how often
I'll actually write to this blog, but keep your eyes peeled.
